# Backlog

Items deferred from feature phases. Each entry has the phase it came from and enough context to action it later.

---

## Feed

**Block filtering in home feed**
Deferred from Phase 4. The web app has no block feature yet (no block table, no block UI, no edge function). When block functionality is built, the home feed services (getForYouFeed, getFollowingFeed, getGroupsFeed) need to fetch the current user's blocked IDs and filter them out of results — same pattern as mobile's getBlockedUserIdsForUser utility.

**Infinite scroll on home feed**
Deferred from Phase 4. Phase 4 fetches only the first page (20 posts) per tab. The service layer is written with cursor-based pagination so adding infinite scroll later only requires changing useQuery to useInfiniteQuery in hooks/useFeed.ts and adding an IntersectionObserver trigger in app/(main)/home/page.tsx.

**Pinned post ordering**
Deferred from Phase 4. Pinned posts are currently ordered by created_at because the web app's posts table has no pinned_at column (mobile has one). When pinned post management is added, a migration should add pinned_at timestamptz to posts and the getForYouFeed service should order pinned posts by pinned_at DESC.

**Optimistic update count rollback**
Like/save mutations roll back local liked/saved boolean state on error (fixed in PR #5). However the displayed likeCount and saveCount are derived from post.likeCount + local toggle delta and will not roll back correctly if the mutation fails. A full fix requires tracking the pre-mutation count and restoring it on error. Deferred until optimistic updates are revisited.

## Community

**Circles wiring**
Deferred from Phase 5. The community_circles table exists with RLS but is empty. The Circles tab still renders its mock entry-card UI from services/community.ts getCurrentCircle. Wiring requires matching logic (persona × time_in_canada pairing), status transitions (default → waiting → in_circle), and a chat surface. Do as its own phase.

**requestGroup edge function**
Deferred from Phase 5. Mobile has sendGroupRequestEmail.ts that POSTs to an edge function; the web has no equivalent. Currently services/community.ts requestGroup is a no-op. Needs an email provider (Resend or similar) plus a Supabase edge function before requestGroup can do anything beyond accepting the form.

**Group member avatar real list**
Deferred from Phase 5. Group.memberAvatars is a UI-only convenience seeded from picsum (per group id). The database has no per-row member-avatar surface; mobile uses a separate signed-URL flow against S3. Replace with real member avatars when group detail pages need them.

## Checklist

**Persona-tag mismatch between web onboarding and Sanity checklist content**
From Phase 10 gap-closing. The web app's `Persona` type has 4 values (`international_student`, `skilled_worker`, `refugee`, `other`). Sanity's `checklist.personas` schema enum lists 6, but content currently uses only 4 tags — measured against `fercgabp/production` (170 docs): `international_student` (83), `skilled_worker` (87), `immigrant` (87), `pr` (87); `refugee` (0) and `protected_person` (0) have no content.

The checklist GROQ filters with `$persona in personas`, so per web persona:
- `international_student` → 83 docs. OK.
- `skilled_worker` → 87 docs. OK — every `immigrant`/`pr` doc is co-tagged `skilled_worker` (0 immigrant/pr-only docs), so nothing is missed today. This relies on the content team continuing to co-tag; an `immigrant`/`pr`-only doc would silently not surface for `skilled_worker` web users.
- `refugee` → 0 docs. A `refugee` web user gets an empty Sanity checklist (custom tasks still show). Note `getTasks` returns mock only when there's no onboarding row — a real persona with 0 matches yields a genuinely empty list, not the mock.
- `other` → 0 docs. Same empty-checklist outcome.

Content/product decision, not a code task in this scope. Options: (a) author `refugee`/`other` checklist content in Sanity, (b) map web personas → Sanity tags in `services/checklist.ts` (e.g. expand the GROQ to match a set), or (c) realign the two persona vocabularies. Flag the empty-checklist UX for `refugee`/`other` users to product.

## Security

**Broad anon grant on live DB**
From Phase 9 pre-launch checklist. Before launch: run REVOKE ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public FROM anon; then re-apply only the three narrow anon SELECT grants needed for pre-login browsing.

**Full security audit**
Run the vibe-security skill against the entire codebase before launch (Phase 9). Focus areas: RLS policies, exposed keys, auth bypass vectors, service role key usage.

---

## Schema

**int4/int8 mismatch between mobile and web databases**
All identity columns in the mobile database are int4 (SERIAL) while the web uses int8 (BIGINT). Safe to read across both, but risky to join or write. Needs reconciliation in Phase 9 before web reads from mobile DB.

**Block user feature**
No block table exists on web. When building block functionality, reference mobile's implementation. Required before block filtering can be added to the feed (see above).

---

## Services

**Remove dead signed-out fallback mock returns**
Across services/feed.ts, services/community.ts, services/checklist.ts, services/companion.ts, and services/profile.ts, each query function has an `if (!await getAuthUserId()) return mock…` branch as a defensive fallback. The (main) route group is gated by the authenticated layout (proxy.ts redirects unauthenticated traffic to /login), so these paths are unreachable in production. Strip them in a separate PR after Phase 6 (Companion) merges, keeping only the `isSupabaseConfigured()` branch for the local-without-env case.

---

## Learn

**Learn UI polish (separate PR after Phase 7 merges):**
- Bring animated dot/squiggle background to the Learn page (already exists in globals.css for Companion)
- Hero carousel at top showing in-progress courses with Continue button and progress indicator (matches mobile pattern)
- Fix filtering/search on the Learn page — currently displays but is not wired up
- Investigate why web may show fewer modules than mobile — check GROQ query vs mobile query

**Submodule landing page pattern:**
- Mobile has a section landing page between submodule and lesson (shows section name, description, progress card with Continue). Web goes directly from submodule to lesson content. Discuss with team whether to add this route level (/learn/[moduleId]/[submoduleId] → /learn/[moduleId]/[submoduleId]/[lessonId]). Architectural change — needs team sign-off.
